description: Open and discuss a specific plan document
---

You are helping with project planning for the LiveSvelte Gettext project.

## What to do

When user runs `/plan P001`:

1. List files in `docs/plans/` to find the plan with that ID
2. Read the plan file
3. Provide a summary including:
   - Plan title
   - Key objectives
   - Current status/progress
   - Any action items or decisions needed
4. Ask: "What aspect of this plan would you like to discuss or work on?"

## Plan Types

Plans are strategic documents that might include:
- Overall project plans (like P001)
- Architecture decision records
- Design documents for major features
- Multi-week initiatives

They differ from tasks (which are concrete, implementable work items).

## Helpful Context

After displaying the plan, you might:
- Suggest creating tasks based on plan sections
- Highlight any outdated information
- Offer to help refine unclear sections
- Point to related tasks or other plans

## Error Handling

- If plan ID not found, list available plans
- If plan file is very long, ask what section they want to focus on
