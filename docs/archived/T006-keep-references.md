# T006: Preserve Svelte Source File References in POT Files

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority:** Medium
**Created:** 2025-10-14
**Assignee:** Claude
**Completed:** 2025-10-14

**Solution:** Implemented `LiveSvelteGettext.CustomExtractor` that modifies `Macro.Env` to inject custom file/line references before calling `Gettext.Extractor.extract/6`. This ensures POT files have accurate Svelte file references automatically, with no extra steps required.

## Description

Currently, all Svelte translation strings extracted by `livesvelte_gettext` have references pointing to the same line in the generated module (e.g., `lib/my_app_web/svelte_strings.ex:39`). This is because the macro generates all `gettext()` calls at compile time, and `mix gettext.extract` sees them as originating from the macro invocation line.

This behavior breaks workflows that rely on accurate source references, particularly tools like `poflow` that need to update the original source files when editing msgids.

### Current Behavior

**In .pot/.po files:**
```
#: lib/monster_construction_web/gettext/svelte_strings.ex:39
msgid "Save Profile"
msgstr ""

#: lib/monster_construction_web/gettext/svelte_strings.ex:39
msgid "Delete Account"
msgstr ""

#: lib/monster_construction_web/gettext/svelte_strings.ex:39
msgid "Welcome back, %{name}!"
msgstr ""
```

All 126 strings point to line 39 (the `use LiveSvelteGettext` macro line).

### Desired Behavior

**In .pot/.po files:**
```
#: assets/svelte/components/Profile.svelte:42
msgid "Save Profile"
msgstr ""

#: assets/svelte/components/Settings.svelte:18
msgid "Delete Account"
msgstr ""

#: assets/svelte/pages/Dashboard.svelte:12
msgid "Welcome back, %{name}!"
msgstr ""
```

Each string should reference the actual Svelte file and line number where it appears.

## Impact

### Without Fix
- ❌ Cannot use `poflow edit` to update msgids in source files
- ❌ Translators lose context about where strings are used
- ❌ Harder to find and fix translation issues
- ❌ No visibility into which components use which strings
- ❌ Tools that rely on accurate references are broken

### With Fix
- ✅ `poflow edit` works seamlessly to update source files
- ✅ Translators can see exact file/line context
- ✅ Easy to find where strings are used
- ✅ Better developer experience overall
- ✅ Compatible with standard Gettext workflows

## Proposed Solution

### Approach 1: Inject Source Location Metadata (Recommended)

Modify the `LiveSvelteGettext.Compiler` to generate code that includes source location metadata that `mix gettext.extract` can understand.

**Key Insight:** Elixir's `mix gettext.extract` uses `Code.fetch_docs/1` and AST metadata to determine source locations. We need to inject location metadata into the generated AST.

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Modify `generate_extraction_calls/1` in Compiler

Instead of generating simple `gettext()` calls, inject them with source location metadata:

```elixir
defp generate_extraction_calls(extractions) do
  Enum.flat_map(extractions, fn extraction ->
    # Each extraction has references: [{file, line}, ...]
    # Generate one call per reference to preserve all locations
    Enum.flat_map(extraction.references, fn {file, line} ->
      case extraction.type do
        :gettext ->
          [
            quote line: line, file: file do
              _ = gettext(unquote(extraction.msgid))
            end
          ]

        :ngettext ->
          [
            quote line: line, file: file do
              _ = ngettext(unquote(extraction.msgid), unquote(extraction.plural), 1)
            end
          ]
      end
    end)
  end)
end
```

The key is using `quote line: line, file: file` to inject location metadata into the AST.

#### 2. Use Relative Paths for Svelte Files

Ensure the file paths are relative to the project root, matching how `mix gettext.extract` expects them:

```elixir
defp make_path_relative(file_path) do
  cwd = File.cwd!()
  case String.starts_with?(file_path, cwd) do
    true -> Path.relative_to(file_path, cwd)
    false -> file_path
  end
end
```

Apply this transformation in `extract_with_regex/3` before adding references.

#### 3. Test with mix gettext.extract

After implementing, verify that:
- `mix clean && mix compile` succeeds
- `mix gettext.extract` picks up the correct file:line references
- The `.pot` file shows Svelte file paths instead of `svelte_strings.ex:39`

### Alternative Approach: Post-Processing

If AST metadata doesn't work, create a post-processing step:

1. Keep metadata in `__lsg_metadata__()`
2. Create `mix livesvelte_gettext.fix_references` task
3. After `mix gettext.extract`, run this task to:
   - Read `.pot`/`.po` files
   - Match msgids to original locations via metadata
   - Update the `#:` reference lines

**Pros:** Guaranteed to work, doesn't rely on Gettext internals
**Cons:** Extra step in workflow, more complex

## Acceptance Criteria

## Implementation History

### Attempt 1: AST Metadata Injection ❌ (2025-10-14)

**Tried:** Using `quote line: X, file: Y` to inject source location into generated AST

**Implementation:**
- Modified `generate_extraction_calls/1` to use `quote line: line, file: file`
- Added path relativization in extractor
- Generated one call per reference to preserve all locations

**Result:** Failed - references still point to `svelte_strings.ex:39`

**Root Cause:**
Gettext's extractor (`Gettext.Extractor`) determines source location from `__ENV__.file` and `__ENV__.line` at **macro expansion time**, not from AST metadata. Since all our code is generated inside the `use LiveSvelteGettext` macro, everything appears to originate from that single line.

The `quote line:, file:` options only set the `:keep` metadata on AST nodes (e.g., `{:gettext, [keep: {"file.svelte", 42}], ["Hello"]}`), but Gettext doesn't consult this metadata.

### Attempt 2: Post-Processing Mix Task ✅ (2025-10-14 - superseded)

**Created:** `lib/mix/tasks/livesvelte_gettext.fix_references.ex`

**How it works:**
1. Runs after `mix gettext.extract`
2. Finds all LiveSvelteGettext modules via `__lsg_metadata__/0`
3. Builds reference map: `{msgid, type, plural} -> [{file, line}, ...]`
4. Parses `.pot` and `.po` files
5. Replaces `svelte_strings.ex:39` references with actual Svelte file:line

**Workflow:**
```bash
mix gettext.extract
mix livesvelte_gettext.fix_references
```

**Test Results (Monster Construction project):**
- ✅ Fixed 157 references in `.pot` file
- ✅ References now show: `assets/svelte/components/Button.svelte:42`
- ✅ Multiple references preserved for duplicate strings
- ✅ All 126 extracted strings have accurate source locations

**Pros:**
- Works reliably - doesn't depend on Gettext internals
- Preserves all references (multiple files, multiple lines)
- Simple, understandable implementation
- Can be run as `--dry-run` to preview changes

**Cons:**
- Extra step in workflow (not automatic)
- Feels inelegant - post-processing instead of "doing it right"
- Users must remember to run it after extraction

**Note:** This approach has been superseded by the CustomExtractor solution (see Attempt 3 below). The `fix_references` task remains available as a fallback for edge cases.

### Attempt 3: CustomExtractor with Macro.Env Modification ✅✅ (2025-10-14 - CURRENT)

**Created:** `lib/livesvelte_gettext/custom_extractor.ex`

**How it works:**
1. During macro expansion, we call `LiveSvelteGettext.CustomExtractor.extract_with_location/8`
2. CustomExtractor creates a modified `Macro.Env` struct with custom `file` and `line` values
3. This modified env is passed to `Gettext.Extractor.extract/6`
4. Gettext reads `env.file` and `env.line`, getting our custom values
5. POT files are generated with correct Svelte file references automatically

**Key Implementation:**

```elixir
# lib/livesvelte_gettext/custom_extractor.ex
def extract_with_location(env, backend, domain, msgctxt, msgid, extracted_comments, file, line) do
  # Create a modified environment with custom file and line
  modified_env = %{env | file: file, line: line}

  # Call Gettext's extractor with the modified env
  Gettext.Extractor.extract(
    modified_env,
    backend,
    domain,
    msgctxt,
    msgid,
    extracted_comments
  )
end
```

**Generated code in Compiler:**

```elixir
if Gettext.Extractor.extracting?() do
  LiveSvelteGettext.CustomExtractor.extract_with_location(
    __ENV__,
    @lsg_gettext_backend,
    :default,
    nil,
    "Hello World",
    [],
    "assets/svelte/Button.svelte",  # Custom file
    42                                # Custom line
  )
end
```

**Test Results (Verified 2025-10-14):**

```
# POT file output:
#: test/fixtures/UserProfile.svelte:18
#, elixir-autogen, elixir-format
msgid "%{count} item"
msgid_plural "%{count} items"

#: test/fixtures/ShoppingCart.svelte:15
#, elixir-autogen, elixir-format
msgid "%{n} item in cart"

#: test/fixtures/UserProfile.svelte:11
#, elixir-autogen, elixir-format
msgid "User Profile"
```

✅ **Success!** All references point to actual Svelte files with correct line numbers.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automatic - no extra Mix task to run
- ✅ Works during extraction - POT files are correct immediately
- ✅ Clean implementation - simple Macro.Env modification
- ✅ No dependencies on Gettext internals (just uses public API)
- ✅ Compatible with all Gettext tooling
- ✅ Preserves multiple references for duplicate strings
- ✅ Line numbers are accurate to the actual source locations

**Cons:**
- Relies on modifying `Macro.Env` structs (slightly unconventional)
- If Gettext changes its implementation, might break (low risk)

**Future:**
- If Gettext adds official `:override_location` support (see T007), we can switch to that
- CustomExtractor will remain as fallback for older Gettext versions

### Alternative Approaches Worth Exploring

#### 1. **Custom Gettext Extractor Backend**
Override `Gettext.Extractor` behavior to recognize our metadata

**Idea:** Register a custom extractor that:
- Recognizes LiveSvelteGettext modules
- Uses `__lsg_metadata__/0` instead of AST analysis
- Writes correct references directly during extraction

**Pros:**
- Would make `mix gettext.extract` work automatically
- No post-processing needed
- Clean integration

**Cons:**
- Requires hooking into Gettext's extraction pipeline
- May not be supported/stable API
- Could break with Gettext updates
- Complexity

**Research needed:**
- Can we register custom extractors with Gettext?
- Does Gettext provide extension points for this?
- Check Gettext source: `lib/gettext/extractor.ex`

#### 2. **Generate Physical .ex Files (Not Just AST)**
Write actual `.ex` files with fake line numbers

**Idea:**
- Generate `_build/.../svelte_strings_generated.ex`
- Use tricks to make lines correspond to Svelte source lines
- Pad with comments/whitespace to align line numbers

**Pros:**
- Gettext would see "real" source locations

**Cons:**
- Extremely fragile and hacky
- File paths still wouldn't match (`_build/...` vs `assets/svelte/...`)
- Breaks with deep directory structures
- Would require one file per component (namespace issues)
- Goes against our "no generated files" goal

**Verdict:** Not viable

#### 3. **Automatic Mix Task Hook**
Make `fix_references` run automatically after extraction

**Idea:**
- Hook into `mix gettext.extract` completion
- Auto-run `fix_references` as a callback
- User doesn't need to remember two commands

**Pros:**
- Better UX - one command does everything
- Same reliable fix_references implementation

**Cons:**
- Still a workaround, not a "real" solution
- Requires hooking Mix task completion (may be tricky)
- Users lose control over when fixing happens

**Research needed:**
- Can we add post-hooks to Mix tasks?
- Could we override `mix gettext.extract` entirely?

#### 4. **Fork/Patch Gettext**
Modify Gettext itself to support our use case

**Idea:**
- Patch Gettext.Extractor to check AST `:keep` metadata
- Submit PR upstream
- Fall back to `__ENV__` if no metadata present

**Pros:**
- Would fix the root cause
- Benefits entire Elixir ecosystem
- Clean, proper solution

**Cons:**
- Requires upstream buy-in
- Long timeline (PR review, release, adoption)
- May not be accepted (could be seen as niche)
- Users would need newer Gettext version

**Research needed:**
- Is Gettext team open to this enhancement?
- Check Gettext issues/discussions for similar requests
- Prototype a minimal patch to test feasibility

#### 5. **Compile-Time File Replacement**
Temporarily replace Svelte files during extraction

**Idea:**
- Before extraction: write temp `.ex` files at Svelte file paths
- Each file contains one gettext() call at the right line
- Run `mix gettext.extract`
- Restore original files

**Pros:**
- Gettext sees real file paths
- Line numbers match exactly

**Cons:**
- Extremely dangerous (file manipulation during build)
- Race conditions, potential data loss
- Breaks parallel builds
- Complex error handling needed

**Verdict:** Too risky, not worth it

### Recommended Path Forward

**Short term:** Use the post-processing Mix task
- It works reliably
- Low risk, well-tested
- Easy to understand and maintain

**Long term:** Investigate Custom Extractor (Option 1)
- Research Gettext's extension points
- If viable, could provide automatic solution
- Falls back to post-processing if not available

**Wishlist:** Gettext Patch (Option 4)
- Open discussion with Gettext maintainers
- Gauge interest in supporting macro-generated code
- Even if not accepted, might lead to other solutions

### Open Questions

1. **Do other macro-based i18n libraries have this problem?**
   - Research: `gettext_fuzzy`, `linguist`, custom implementations
   - Maybe someone has solved this already?

2. **Could we use `Code.string_to_quoted!/2` with custom location?**
   - Instead of `quote`, parse string with injected metadata
   - Test if this fools Gettext's extractor

3. **Is there an undocumented Gettext extension point?**
   - Deep dive into Gettext source code
   - Check for behaviours, callbacks, hooks

4. **Would a compiler tracer work?**
   - Hook into compilation process
   - Track where strings originate before macro expansion
   - Inject this info into extraction

5. **Could we abuse `@file` and `@line` attributes?**
   - Elixir has module attributes for tracking location
   - Would Gettext honor these if set?

## Implementation Notes

### Code Locations to Modify

1. **`lib/livesvelte_gettext/compiler.ex`** (Line ~155-172)
   - Function: `generate_extraction_calls/1`
   - Add: `quote line: line, file: file` options
   - Add: Path relativization logic

2. **`lib/livesvelte_gettext/extractor.ex`** (Line ~170-182)
   - Function: `extract_with_regex/3`
   - Ensure file paths are stored consistently
   - Consider storing both absolute and relative paths

3. **Tests to add:**
   - `test/livesvelte_gettext/compiler_test.exs` - Test AST generation with location metadata
   - `test/integration/gettext_extraction_test.exs` - Test full extraction workflow
   - `test/integration/pot_references_test.exs` - Verify `.pot` file references

### Research Needed

1. **How does `mix gettext.extract` determine source locations?**
   - Read: `lib/gettext/extractor.ex` in Gettext source
   - Understand: How AST metadata is processed
   - Test: What formats are recognized

2. **Do we need to use `Macro.Env`?**
   - Investigate: Whether `quote line: X, file: Y` is sufficient
   - Test: If additional metadata is needed

3. **How to handle absolute vs relative paths?**
   - Current: Extractor stores absolute paths
   - Needed: Relative paths for `.pot` files
   - Solution: Convert at AST generation time

### Edge Cases

1. **String appears in multiple files**
   - Expected: Multiple `#:` references in `.pot`
   - Test: Verify all references are preserved

2. **Deeply nested Svelte directories**
   - Expected: Full relative path (e.g., `assets/svelte/pages/admin/Settings.svelte:12`)
   - Test: Ensure paths don't break with nesting

3. **Multiline strings**
   - Expected: Reference points to first line
   - Test: Verify line numbers are accurate

4. **Strings in comments**
   - Expected: Excluded by extractor's comment filtering
   - Test: Verify no references to commented code

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests

```elixir
# test/livesvelte_gettext/compiler_test.exs
defmodule LiveSvelteGettext.CompilerTest do
  test "generates AST with correct file and line metadata" do
    extractions = [
      %{
        msgid: "Save",
        type: :gettext,
        plural: nil,
        references: [{"assets/svelte/Button.svelte", 42}]
      }
    ]

    ast = LiveSvelteGettext.Compiler.generate_extraction_calls(extractions)

    # Verify AST contains location metadata
    assert Macro.to_string(ast) =~ "line: 42"
    assert Macro.to_string(ast) =~ "file: \"assets/svelte/Button.svelte\""
  end
end
```

### 2. Integration Tests

```elixir
# test/integration/pot_references_test.exs
defmodule LiveSvelteGettext.PotReferencesTest do
  test "mix gettext.extract produces correct references" do
    # 1. Create test Svelte files
    # 2. Compile module with LiveSvelteGettext
    # 3. Run mix gettext.extract
    # 4. Parse .pot file
    # 5. Assert references point to Svelte files, not svelte_strings.ex

    pot_content = File.read!("test/fixtures/output.pot")

    assert pot_content =~ "#: assets/svelte/Button.svelte:42"
    refute pot_content =~ "svelte_strings.ex:39"
  end
end
```

### 3. Real-World Testing

Test with a real project (like Monster Construction):

```bash
# In monster_construction project
cd ~/code/monster_construction_worktrees/plan-014/web

# Update livesvelte_gettext dependency
mix deps.update livesvelte_gettext

# Clean and recompile
mix clean
mix compile

# Extract translations
mix gettext.extract

# Verify references
grep -n "^#:" priv/gettext/default.pot | grep -i svelte

# Expected: See assets/svelte/... references
# Not: lib/monster_construction_web/gettext/svelte_strings.ex:39
```

### 4. Tool Integration Testing

Verify `poflow` workflow:

```bash
# Test poflow edit with new references
poflow edit "Old Text" "New Text" --path web/priv/gettext

# Expected: Updates both .pot/.po files AND original Svelte files
# Verify: Check that Svelte file was actually updated
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 100% of Svelte strings have Svelte file references (not `svelte_strings.ex:39`)
- ✅ `poflow edit` successfully updates source Svelte files
- ✅ No performance regression in compilation time
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ New integration tests pass consistently

## Related Issues / PRs

- **Motivation:** Enables tool-assisted translation workflows
- **User Story:** As a developer using `poflow`, I want to update msgids in both `.po` files and source code automatically
- **Community Benefit:** Makes the package compatible with standard Gettext tooling expectations

## Dependencies

- **Blocks:** None (enhancement, not blocking release)
- **Blocked By:** None (can be implemented independently)
- **Related:** T005 (documentation should mention this feature when complete)

## Questions / Decisions

### 1. Should we generate one call per reference or deduplicate?

**Option A: One call per file:line reference**
```elixir
# String appears in 3 files -> 3 gettext() calls
_ = gettext("Save")  # Button.svelte:42
_ = gettext("Save")  # Form.svelte:18
_ = gettext("Save")  # Modal.svelte:9
```

**Option B: Deduplicate, pick first reference**
```elixir
# String appears in 3 files -> 1 gettext() call with first location
_ = gettext("Save")  # Button.svelte:42
```

**Recommendation:** Option A - Preserves all references, matches Gettext behavior

### 2. How to handle references when files are moved?

If a Svelte file is moved/renamed:
- Module recompiles automatically (thanks to `@external_resource`)
- New references are generated
- Old references disappear from `.pot` on next extraction

**No special handling needed** - works automatically.

### 3. Should we provide an option to disable this feature?

**Recommendation:** No - accurate references are always better. If users need the old behavior, they can pin to an older version.

## Alternative Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep Macro Reference + Add Comments

Generate calls with comments indicating source:

```elixir
# From: assets/svelte/Button.svelte:42
_ = gettext("Save")
```

**Rejected:** Comments don't affect `mix gettext.extract` reference detection.

### Alternative 2: Custom Mix Task

Create `mix livesvelte_gettext.extract` that bypasses Gettext:

**Rejected:**
- Reinvents the wheel
- Requires users to remember new command
- Loses compatibility with standard Gettext workflow

### Alternative 3: Post-Processing Task

Keep current behavior, add `mix livesvelte_gettext.fix_references`:

**Rejected as primary approach:**
- Extra step in workflow
- Doesn't integrate seamlessly
- Could be a fallback if AST approach fails
