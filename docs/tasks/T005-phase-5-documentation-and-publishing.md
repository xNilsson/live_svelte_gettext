# T005: Phase 5 - Documentation & Publishing

**Status:** Not Started
**Phase:** 5 - Documentation & Publishing
**Assignee:**
**Created:** 2025-10-14
**Completed:**

## Description

Write comprehensive documentation and publish the library to Hex.pm (and optionally npm for the TypeScript client). This makes the library usable by the community.

This should be done in two steps.
Step 1: Documentation.
Step 2: Publishing.

After step 1 I will try to use this library on a local project. When I've verified that 
it works as expected and we have iterated on impromevents (if any) then we can move on to step 2

## Implementation Notes

Documentation priority:
1. README (most important - first impression)
2. Module docs (for HexDocs)
3. CHANGELOG (for transparency)
4. Contributing guidelines (for community)

README structure:
- Hook readers quickly (show the problem + solution)
- One-command installation
- 5-minute quick start
- Link to full docs on HexDocs
- Clear examples with code snippets

CI setup:
- Use GitHub Actions
- Test on Elixir 1.14, 1.15, 1.16
- OTP 25, 26
- Cache dependencies for speed

Hex publishing checklist:
- Run `mix hex.build` first to check
- Review package contents
- Test in a fresh project before publishing
- Can't unpublish, so be careful!

Community engagement:
- Be responsive to issues
- Welcome first-time contributors
- Keep scope focused (say no to feature creep)
